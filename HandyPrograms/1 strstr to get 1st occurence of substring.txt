/* strstr returns a char pointer (pointer contains address of the1st char)
 *strstr gets the first occurence of "par" in p i.e it has address of p in 1st par
 * now we increment p so it will be at a of 1st par and goes back to chk while condn
 *now strstr sets the p (addr) to the location of p in repar 
 *so on we continue and incremen total to count par sub str occurences
